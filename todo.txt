- Seems like the model collapses:
	- add curves like Fig.2 in SimSiam
	- check for collapse 
	- add knn classifier [36] during and after training
- add multi gpu support
- implement warmup & add lars
- different scale parameters in last BN layers for every residual block
- parametrize augmentations and add to config
- test for each dataset, (e.g. STL10 is different as we do not have that many labels)
